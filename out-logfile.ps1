        #In this case if we hit this error code - one of two things happen.
        #If the call is from another function that is not in a do while - the error is logged and we continue with exiting.
        #If the call is from a function in a do while - write-error rethrows the exception.  The exception is caught by the caller where a retry occurs.
        #This is how we end up logging an error then looping back around.
